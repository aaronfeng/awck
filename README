I was bored, so I started to implement ack (http://betterthangrep.com/)
in awk.  It is a very simplistic version of ack.

Usage: ./awck search_pattern [path]

examples:
./awck debugger jquery.js
./awck [0-9]+ ../jquery.js

Since it is not as featureful as ack (but gets the job done), it seems to be
a bit faster than ack.

> time ack [0-9]+ jquery.js > /dev/null

real  0m0.188s
user  0m0.071s
sys 0m0.055s

> time ./awck [0-9]+ jquery.js > /dev/null

real  0m0.022s
user  0m0.015s
sys 0m0.005s

TODO:

* The ability to ignore non-code files (turn this thing from grep to ack).
